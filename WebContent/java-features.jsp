<p><h1>Java Features</h1>
									<p>Simple and small, Familiar, Object Oriented, Distributed, two
										Staged, platform Independent, Robust and Secure,
										Multithreaded, High performance, Dynamic, Extensible.</p> <br>
									<p><b>Simple and Small:</b> </p>
										<p>Java is a simple and small language
										that can be learned easily, even if you have just started
										programming, and many features of C and CPP that are not added
										here like pointers, preprocessor header files, GOTO, SIZE OF,
										and TYPEDEF statement and JAVA does not contain data types
										STRUCT, and JAVA does not support operator overloading,
										template classes, multiple inheritance, global variables,
										pointers, header files and many others <br><p> <b>Familiar:</b></p>
										It is familiar language because java uses many constructs of C
										and CPP and therefore java is looks like a CPP code. <br>
										<p><b>Object Oriented: </b> </p>Almost everything in java is a class,
										or an object. Any code that you write in java is inside a
										class. Java is purely Object Oriented and provides
										Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance and Polymorphism. An
										Object is a software bundle of variables and related methods.
										<br><p> <b>Distributed:</b>  </p>Java is designed as a
										distributed language for creating applications on network it
										has the ability to share both data and programs. Java
										applications can open and access remote objects on internet
										very easily. RMI packages are used for creating distributed
										server and client application. <br> <p><b>Two Stage Systems: </b> </p>Java is both compiled and interpreted language.
										Compiler (javac) is used to translate a java program into an
										intermediate language called java byte code (.class files), it
										is platform independent code and interpreter (java) is used to
										read each byte code instruction and to run on the computer. <br>
										<p><b>Platform Independence:</b> </p> We know that, java compiler
										produce the byte code. The byte code can be executed on a
										variety of computers running on different operating systems
										such as windows 95/98, Windows NT, Sun Solaris and Mac OS.
										Another reason is, size of the primitive data types are
										machine independent. <br><p> <b>Robust:</b> </p>Java is a robust
										language because it provides many safeguards to ensure
										reliable code. It has strict compile time checking, runtime
										checking, it is designed as a garbage-collected language to
										free the programmers from all memory management problems. Also
										provides the exception handling technique to handle the
										exceptions occurred at runtime. <br> <p><b>Secure:</b> </p>
										Security is very important issue when you are going to
										implement a network based application. Java system doesn'€™t
										allow the virus affected applets to run. We are not using the
										pointers here, so programs cannot gain access to memory
										locations without proper authorization. <br> <p><b>Multithreaded:</b></p>
										Multithreading is the ability of an application to perform
										multiple tasks at the same time. For example when you watch a
										movie on your computer, one task of program is to handle sound
										effects and another handle screen display so simple programs
										do many tasks simultaneously. <br><p> <b>High
											Performance:</b> </p>Java byte code was efficiently designed so that
										it would be easy to translate directly into native machine
										code for high performance by using a Just-in-Time (JIT)
										compiler. Java is faster than other interpreted language.
										Since it is compiled and interpreted. Multithreading provides
										the overall execution speed of java programs. <br><p> <b>Dynamic:</b> </p>
										Maintaining different versions of an application is very easy
										in Java.Java is capable of dynamically linking in new class
										libraries, methods and objects. In java almost everything will
										be done at run time. <br><p> <b>Extensible:</b>  </p>Java
										programs support functions written in other languages such as
										C and CPP. These functions are known as native methods. Native
										methods are linked dynamically at runtime.
