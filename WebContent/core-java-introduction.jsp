<p><h1>Introduction of Java</h1>
		<p><b>About Java: </b>
									<p>Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming
										language. This means that the language is based on the concept
										of an object. You can use Java to write computer applications
										and thousands of other things computer software can do. Using
										java we can build special programs called applets. Applet is a
										small java program that can be downloaded from the Internet
										and played safely within a web browser.</p>

			<b>Procedural programming:</b>A procedural program divides the code
			into smaller blocks called procedures. These procedures can interact
			with each other. The most important point to note in procedural
			programming is the idea of state. The state of a program is stored in
			variables. As the program execution goes on, the state changes. The
			actions (procedures or functions) will change the state (value of the
			variables). Prolog, Pascal, FORTRAN and PL/SQL are examples.
		<p>
			<b>Drawbacks:</b>In procedural language, if the programming code goes
			beyond around 25,000 lines, it becomes unmanageable and especially
			when the project comes for modification at a later stage.
		<p>
			<b>Structured programming:</b>Structured programming is a design
			approach where complex systems are broken down into smaller and more
			manageable pieces. That is, the programmer divides the programs
			source code into logically structured chunks (blocks) of code. The
			advantage is, it makes programs more readable, more reliable and more
			easily maintainer. Structured programming can be seen as a subset of
			procedural programming. It is most famous for removing or reducing
			dependency on the GOTO statement. Delphi and COBOL are examples of
			structured programming language.
		<p>
			<b>Advantages of structured programming language:</b>
		</p>
		<p>Structured programming reduces the complexity. Modularity
			allows the programmer to tackle problems in logical fashion. Also,
			using logical structures ensure that the flow of control is clear and
			readable.

		<b>Types of Java Applications</b>
		<p><b>1.Web Application:</b> We can create server-side web applications by using java programming language. At present In java we are using Servlet, JSP, Struts, JSF etc. technologies to create Web Application.
<p><b>2.Standalone Application:</b> We can call it as desktop application or window-based application. We need to install an application on each and every machine or server such as media player, antivirus etc. At present In java we are using AWT and Swing for creating standalone applications.
	<p><b>3.Enterprise Application:</b> Enterprise application is distributed in nature. Example is banking applications etc. Enterprise has advantages those are high-level security, load balancing, and clustering. In Java we use EJB for creating enterprise applications.
		<p><b>4.Mobile Application:</b> For mobile devices Java is used to create application software. At present, For smaller devices Java ME (Java Mobile Edition) is used for creating applications. And one main thing is Java is a programming language for Google Android application development.
